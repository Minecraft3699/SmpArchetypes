# NOTICE
## I NO LONGER HAVE TIME TO CREATE ABILITIES FOR YOU!
This repository remains public for documentation by the many examples it provides, and for receiving pull requests.
If you want your abilities added to the SMP Server you **must** make them yourself or have **someone else** do it.

While it is very fun developing for this project, I **DO NOT HAVE THE TIME** for this.

The needed blockbench model file to animate is at https://github.com/KosmX/emotes/tree/dev/blender
